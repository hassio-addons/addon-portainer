Manage your Docker environment with ease.

## About

Portainer is an open-source lightweight management UI which allows you to
easily manage your a Docker host(s) or Docker swarm clusters.

It has never been so easy to manage Docker. Portainer provides a detailed
overview of Docker and allows you to manage containers, images, networks and
volumes.

## WARNING 1

The Portainer add-on is really powerful and gives you access to virtually
your whole system. While this add-on is created and maintained with care and
with security in mind, in the wrong or inexperienced hands,
it could damage your system.

## WARNING 2

The Portainer add-on is meant for debugging Home Assistant and its containers.
It has not meant or designed for managing or deploying your custom software
or third-party containers.

**Home Assistant DOES NOT SUPPORT running third party containers**
on Home Assistant OS or Supervised installation types. Ignoring this, will
render your system as unsupported!
