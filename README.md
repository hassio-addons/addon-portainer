Manage your Docker environment with ease.

![The Portainer Hass.io add-on](images/screenshot.png)

## About

Portainer is an open-source lightweight management UI which allows you to
easily manage your a Docker host(s) or Docker swarm clusters.

It has never been so easy to manage Docker. Portainer provides a detailed
overview of Docker and allows you to manage containers, images, networks and
volumes.

## WARNING

The Portainer add-on is really powerful and gives you virtually access to
your whole system. While this add-on is created and maintained with care and
with security in mind, in the wrong or inexperienced hands,
it could damage your system.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

To be able to use this add-on, you'll need to disable protection mode on this
add-on. Without it, the add-on is unable to access Docker.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Portainer" add-on.
1. Set the "Protection mode" switch to off.
1. Start the "Portainer" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Portainer" to see if everything went well.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
    "log_level": "info",
    "ssl": true,
    "certfile": "fullchain.pem",
    "keyfile": "privkey.pem"
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface.
Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_

### Option: `hide_hassio_containers`

By default all Hassio managed containers are hidden from Portainer.
This is recommended since fooling around with Hassio managed containers
can easily lead to a broken system.

1. Set this option to `false`, to gain access to Hassio managed containers as well.
2. Go into Portainer -> Settings -> Hidden containers: Delete the listed hidden labels (io.hass.type labels).

### Option: `leave_front_door_open`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows you to disable
authentication by setting it to `true`.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest, not to use this, even if this add-on is
only exposed to your internal network. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

## Embedding into Home Assistant

It is possible to embed Portainer directly into Home Assistant, allowing you to
access Portainer through the Home Assistant frontend.

Home Assistant provides the `panel_iframe` component, for these purposes.

Example configuration:

```yaml
panel_iframe:
  portainer:
    title: Portainer
    icon: mdi:docker
    url: https://addres.to.your.hass.io:9000
```
